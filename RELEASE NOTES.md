Version 1.3.3

- Fixed `if (!object)` because it casts the object to char and may lead to a bug with some pointers.

- Now throws an exception if you try to encode an invalid object type instead of merely logging to console

Version 1.3.1

- Fixed singleton implementation

- Removed account parameter (it didn't work the way I thought)

Version 1.1

- Now uses application bundle ID to namespace the default keychain
- Now supports keyed subcripting (e.g. keychain["foo"] = bar;)

- Incuded Mac example
